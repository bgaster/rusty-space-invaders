//! Description: 
//! 
//! Simple entity system for our game. We could of course use an ECS, but as
//! the whole point is to port this game over to the 32blit when it's ready,
//! this seemed like overkill and potentially impact on portability. I want
//! an engine that is very simply and low overhead.
