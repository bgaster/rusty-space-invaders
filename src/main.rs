//! Description: 
//!   An emulation of the original space invaders. The behaviour follows that described at:
//! 
//!         Chris Cantrell
//!         https://computerarcheology.com/Arcade/SpaceInvaders/
//!         
//! It is not an direct copy, in particular, the timing is similar, but I've not made any real effort to match
//! it percisely. It is not implemented as per the original game, using the 2 screen interrupts and so on, insead
//! it uses a simply timer based for the main alien swarm and the other elements, e.g. bullets, just run at their 
//! own rate, both for animations, and for movement. It does not use an ECS, which if I was doing anything more 
//! complicated I should have. Next project I plan to, but this was just a small few day project while I sat around
//! complaining about a horrid tooth ache, which has now been fixed with a root canal :-)
//! 
//! It is worth noting that the main goal of the project is to port it to the 32blit, a small 32-bit MCU based 
//! retro games console, which I backed on Kickstarter and should be arriving soon. More details of this here:
//! 
//!     https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/pimoroni/32blit-retro-inspired-handheld-with-open-source-fi
//! 
//! See the README.md for move information.
